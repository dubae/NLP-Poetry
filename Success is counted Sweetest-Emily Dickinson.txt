Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.

Not one of all the purple Host
Who took the Flag to-day
Can tell the definition
So clear, of Victory

As he, defeated -dying -
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break, agonized and clear!
